# Each pool is a list of (value, weight) pairs; weights are relative. They make
# the COMMON real case dominant (white-ish, round, top-down) while keeping a
# diverse minority, so the model performs on typical restaurant plates yet stays
# robust to rarer ones ("dominant-but-diverse"). Weights are easy to tune - e.g.
# to match the real_restaurant_cctv reference photos.
#
# KEY INVARIANT: these pools are sampled INDEPENDENTLY of the class, so plate
# appearance carries no label information and cannot become a shortcut.

# Plate style bundles color + material/texture coherently (article baked in).
